      <b>A Message From Our Co-Founder</b></font

    <br />
    <font size="4" color="#0a0e0c" face="century gothic" align="center">
      When I was doimg my schooling I noticed that I have deep interest in<br />
      books.I'm a kind of person who makes friends with whom my vibe is<br />
      matching. In real world I was failed to find such match so I tried on<br />
      books and now I'm glad that books are my friends instead of humans.
      They<br />
      never cheated on me rather they taught me to be a wise person and to be
      a<br />
      good friend of ourselves. When I stuck in my real world problems then I<br />
      used to read best book suited on my particular situation and end
      reading<br />
      by having possible solution from such book. The things or facts which
      I've<br />
      learnt from books were actually the things that no one taught me before.
      I<br />
      always wanted to do something great from where I could feel honoured
      like:<br />
      to own a Library where I could arrange or read books according to my<br />
      choice or; building such site where I could serve people like me their<br />
      best choice's books. So I decided to do so. Now I made a website from<br />
      where people or even I can access or share or read our favourite books.
      We<br />
      can make our own <font color="crimson">BOOKSHELVES</font> containing books which we want to read or<br />
      which we have already read. I always wanted to know who are reading
      which<br />
      books and which books are the choice of youngsters and other ages of<br />
      people and through this webbsite I made this possible. I believe in<br />
      sharing knowledge, so that we could have some sort of same or even
      wiser<br />
      mindsets. <font color="crimson">"Because knowledge is power and power is best shared among<br />
      readers."</font> I also start writing books which will consist of my own
      thoughts<br />
      and imaginatoions I'll publish my books on my website soon then the<br />
      readers can download or buy it through my site.
